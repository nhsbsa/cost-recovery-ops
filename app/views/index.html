            <ul>
              <li>The second iteration of Mixed Age group claim and resubmissions with updated content following latest round of regular resubmissions testing using version 41.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We did not need to test this specific type of resubmission as this iteration was more to bring the Mixed Age claim design and content in-line with Version 41.</p>

            <p>This iteration has been set-up with the following scenario in mind:<br>
            <ol>
              <li>Firstly, search for the claim by ID (123456)</li>
              <li>Create a new resubmission shell for claim 123456, and then add invoices to the resubmission</li>
              <li>Review the invoices within the resubmission including adding the reason for contestation, uploading any evidence, and investigating the invoices and entitlement details to make a decision to either Maintain, Withdraw or Partially maintain and withdraw.</li>
              <li>Once happy with each invoice within the resubmission, send it for peer review</li>
              <li>Peer review the resubmission, and once done, mark it as "Peer reviewed"</li>
              <li>Enter details r.e., when the resub was sent/uploaded to DHSC and the Member State, moving it to a "Complete" status</li>
            </ol>

            <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">What we created:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Various content improvements throughout the resubmissions process.</li>
              <li>Streamlined and improved the Partially maintain and withdraw journey by removing the <a href="version-40/uk-claims/resubmissions/confirm-partially-maintained-and-partially-withdrawn-months">Enter the number of months partially maintained and withdrawn screen (opens a previous prototype iteration)</a> by instead asking users to enter the revised accounting period (which is the period of months they wish to maintain) and enter the total number of months all on one screen. We anticipate this will remove complexity involved in entering the revised accounting period, and ensuring the total number of maintained and withdrawn months calculates correctly.</li>
              <li>Added linked claims and resubmissions table to the individual S1 entitlement on a person's record in the <a href="version-41/s1/account/entitlements-and-treatments">Entitlements and treatments section</a>.</li>
              <li>Added inset text to the <a href="version-40/uk-claims/resubmissions/check-invoices-added-to-resubmission">confirm invoices you want to add to the resubmission screen</a> guiding users to add invoices if the scenario where they have removed all previously selected/added invoices from the resubmission shell</li>
              <li>Improved <a href="version-41/s1/account/personal-details">update person details journeys</a> including First and last names, Current address, Date of birth and additional details including Sex, Nationality, UK National Insurance Number (NINO) and Contact number.</li>
              <li>Improved <a href="version-41/s1/account/entitlement-content/s1-entitlement-details">update entitlement details journeys</a> including First and last names, Date of birth, Personal identification number (PIN), and Date of residency in UK.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">What we plan to test:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The improved resubmission journey with key focus on content tweaks and the streamlined Partially maintain and withdraw journey.</li>
              <li>The <a href="version-41/s1/account/entitlements-and-treatments">Entitlements and treatments screen</a> where we display all claims and resubmissions an individual S1 is linked to.</li>
              <li>The <a href="version-41/uk-claims/resubmissions/check-invoices-added-to-resubmission">interface displaying the inset text and 'Add invoices' button</a> in the scenario where the user has removed all previously selected/added invoices from the resubmission shell.</li>

              <li>Create a new resubmission shell for claim 100005, and then add invoices to the resubmission</li>
              <li>Review the invoices within the resubmission including adding the reason for contestation, uploading any evidence, and investigating the invoices and entitlement details to make a decision to either Maintain, Withdraw or Partially maintain and withdraw.</li>
              <li>From an individual invoice and their details, navigate to their entitlements and treatments on their person record. Open up the S1 entitlement and review the linked claims and resubmissions associated with this entitlement.</li>

            <br>

            <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">What we found:</h3>
            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
              <li>Including the total number of contested months on the <a href="version-41/uk-claims/resubmissions/claim-summary">Claim summary</a> is technically complex because we don't record the number of contested months per individual invoice, therefore, this data has been removed.</li>
              <li>All users could correctly explain the difference between 'Claimed' and 'Remaining' values on the <a href="version-41/uk-claims/resubmissions/claim-invoices">Claim invoices screen</a> - including when an invoice is only showing 'Claimed' values meaning that they've yet to be in a completed resubmission. They found this useful, particularly when completing Decision S11 work, or responding to DHSC queries and needing a quick 'at-a-glance' view of an individual invoice's value within the overall claim. Users could also understand the design rationale, given the limitations we had in designing the screen effectively.</li>
              <li>As part of this prototype iteration, a decision was made to add the Acknowledgement letter back onto the <a href="version-41/uk-claims/resubmissions/confirmation-resubmission-created">Confirmation resubmission created screen</a>, however, in UR, users pointed out that the 'Date the acknowledgement letter was sent to the member state' (required input on the <a href="version-40/uk-claims/resubmissions/create-new-resubmission">Create a new resubmission screen</a>) may not be accurate, particularly when dealing with postal resubmissions because they are asked to enter this date before actually being able to download and send the Acknowledgement letter which appears on the confirmation screen. For RINA resubmissions, there is no risk because the acknowledgement is sent immediately after the Claims Officer begins working the resubmission - it does not require them to find and download the letter, meaning that, users should have sent the acknowledgement prior to creating a new resubmission shell on the MOET system. Stakeholders are, however, aware of the risk involed with postal resubs and agree that the process will be improved post-MVP.</li>
              <li>Users expected that the 'Months' and 'Accounting period' shown on the <a href="version-41/uk-claims/resubmissions/invoices-within-resubmission">Invoices within resubmission screen</a> would, at first, only show the latest/current value that each individual invoice is sat at i.e., if it's the first resub, it would be the original, claimed value, or if it was the fourth resub, it would be the remaining value after completing the third resubmission. Once users 'worked' each invoice, they would then see the 'Previous' and 'Remaining' values, allowing them to clearly see what decision had been made, and the amount of months maintained/withdrawn. This would also enable users to see which invoices are still to be worked, as not only would they only show a single value, but their status would still be sat as 'Contested'.</li>
              <li>Users do not need to see the 'original' claimed value on the <a href="version-41/uk-claims/resubmissions/invoices-within-resubmission">Invoices within resubmission screen</a>, they instead, would expect to find this information within the individual <a href="version-40/uk-claims/resubmissions/invoice-details?invoice=Jane">Invoice details</a> or on the overall <a href="version-40/uk-claims/resubmissions/claim-invoices">Claim invoices screen</a>.</li>
              <li>Users really liked the improved display of previous claim and resubmission values within the individual Maintain/Withdraw/Partial journeys. Users said that they like that it's tucked away within a <a href="version-40/uk-claims/resubmissions/enter-revised-accounting-period">details component</a> it avoids initially cluttering screens when they first land on them, but if they feel they need access to this information during these journeys, they know they can reveal this information when they need it.</li>
              <li>Once Cost Recovery have cancelled an S1 entitlement, Claims Officers will make the decision against the invoice. This step is particularly important during the Partial journey as we display the entitlement start and end date on the <a href="version-40/uk-claims/resubmissions/enter-revised-accounting-period">first screen</a> in that journey to help users correctly enter the revised accounting period. Users understood this additional information and confirmed it would help them enter the correct dates, albeit they did question why they needed to enter the revised accounting period if it's 9/10 times going to match the entitlement start and end date.</li>
              <li>Most users correctly input the <a href="version-41/uk-claims/resubmissions/enter-revised-accounting-period">revised accounting period</a> within the Partial journey. Some users were still a bit unsure on the exact dates they should be inputting as they know in their minds that we can only claim in whole months which meant that where we'd expect them to input the accounting period end date as the day after a person died, for example, they're actually inputting the last day of the month. However, users expressed that with training and time, they would become familiar with the correct process and system functionality.</li>
              <li>At the time of testing the Partial journey, on the <a href="version-41/uk-claims/resubmissions/cya-partial-maintain-and-partial-withdraw">CYA screen</a>, we were displaying the Revised accounting period (Period of maintained months), the withdrawn months, and the reason, withdrawal source, and optional additional comments - users said that they're happy to see that the total number of withdrawn months was automatically calculated by the system, based on the revised accounting period they'd input. If this total number of withdrawn months didn't look correct, they'd know they'd need to change the revised accounting period. Additionally, they also said they'd only need to be shown either the total number of maintained or total number of withdrawn months because both would be overkill, and they would be able to do some simple math to work out one or the other. However, after testing, the development team realised it would be significant effort to build the system so that it automatically calculates the total number of maintained and withdrawn months based on whatever revised accounting period the user enters. Instead, users will have to enter the total number of months they want to maintain alongside the revised accounting period, therefore, the UCD team agreed to remove all withdrawn-related info from this journey so that users only focus on what is being maintained to align with RINA. We also understand that users can very simply calculate what has been withdrawn using previous values and maintained values to find out what was withdrawn per resubmission.</li>
              <li>Once a decision has been made against an individual invoice and users go back into the <a href="version-40/uk-claims/resubmissions/invoice-details?invoice=John&status=Partial">invoice details screen</a>, users largely understand the information on display i.e., Original, previously maintained, and remaining values. However, some users did say that it could be made clearer that the 'previously maintained' values come directly from the last resubmission, rather than the entire claim. The UCD team, however, agreed that adding additional words such as 'Previously maintained months from latest resubmission' just adds additional words to an already busy screen. Instead, we hope that with training and use of the system, users will quickly understand what 'Previously maintained' is referring to.</li>
              <li>Users like that we now display all <a href="version-41/s1/account/entitlements-and-treatments">claims and resubmissions linked to S1 entitlements</a> as it will help them complete Decision S11 work, as well as correctly process Credit Notes by being able to clearly see all claims and resubs that they need to credit back to the Member State. This said, we initially designed the interface so that both the Claim ID and Invoice ID were links. The Claim ID redirects users to the individual claim, landing on the Claim summary screen whereas the Invoice ID could only redirect users to the Claim invoices screen because we show individual invoices per resubmission so it would be impossible to link to an individual invoice per person which covers all resubmissions. As a result of users testing these links, we found that users would prefer if instead of linking to the Claim invoices screen, if instead we could link to the individual resubmissions linked to the entitlement. This would speed up various processes for users as it reduces the need for them to search for the individual resubmissions.</li>
              <li>Overall, changes made to content and design from the previous prototype iteration were very well received, enabling users to access the information they need throughout key areas in the resubmissions process, allowing them to complete tasks more efficiently. Users acknowledge that with time, and training, they will become familiar with new processes and system functionality, and can see the benefits these will have in their day-to-day work.</li>
              
              <br>

              <li>Users could not think of a reason why they would remove every invoice from the <a href="version-41/uk-claims/resubmissions/check-invoices-added-to-resubmission">Confirm you want to add these invoices to the resubmission screen</a>. They would likely only ever remove a select few invoices from that screen only if/when they realise they might have made a mistake e.g., selecting the wrong invoice in the first instance.</li>
              <li>Users would not click the 'Continue' button on the <a href="version-41/uk-claims/resubmissions/check-invoices-added-to-resubmission">Confirm you want to add these invoices to the resubmission screen</a> if they had removed all invoices from the resubmission shell because it does not make sense to them to continue if there are no invoices in the resubmission shell.</li>
              <li>If users wanted to return back to the empty resubmission shell, they would use the breadcrumbs to do this.</li>
              <li>In the <a href="version-41/uk-claims/resubmissions/invoice-details?invoice=Jane">edge case scenario where an invoice has been previously fully withdrawn</a>, users would prefer if the 'Partial' button was disabled rather than completely removed due to the fact that they used to the current button layout/user interface. They said removing the 'Partial' button might instead cause confusion or they might think something was wrong with the system so keeping the button but preventing users from being able to click/go down the 'Partial' route prevents users from making a mistake.</li>

              <br>

              <li>Users are not used to identifying entitlements by ID so would like the entitlement start and end dates within each heading on the <a href="version-41/s1/account/case-history-entitlements">Case history - Entitlements</a> screen to help them correctly locate the correct entitlement when viewing updates.</li>
              <li>Users sometimes receive contact numbers containing the country/area code. Rather than making this mandatory to enter, or not asking users to enter it at all on the <a href="version-41/s1/account/change-additional-personal-details">Add or Change additional personal details</a> screens, instead we should make the hint text clearer so that users should enter the country/area code only if they know it.</li>

              <li>Button content within the <a href="version-40/uk-claims/resubmissions/invoice-details?invoice=John">Invoice details</a> has changed from "Partially maintain and withdraw" to just "Partial" which means the button is not only concise but is also able to sit on the same lines as the "Maintain" and "Withdraw" buttons. To view the buttons, you must select a reason for contestation and Save and submit.</li>
              <li>We have also removed two rows from the <a href="version-40/uk-claims/resubmissions/resubmission-summary">Resubmission summary:</a> "Total number of maintained invoices, including those partially maintained" and "Total number of maintained invoices, including those partially maintained" because this is unnecessary information that could cause users confusion if the total amounts
                 exceed the total number of contested invoices. This happens because 1 invoice can be split across both Maintained and Withdrawn if they're set as Partial, meaning that it would look like 2 invoices have been actioned, when actually it's just the same invoice split across maintain and withdraw. But we know that invoices themselves aren't what is maintained/withdrawn/partially maintained and withdrawn but it's the <b>months</b> that are.</li>

            <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">What we found:</h3>
            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
              <li>Users would like the front-end design of the <a href="version-39a/uk-claims/resubmissions/claim-invoices">Invoices within the claim screen</a> to display the original months claimed and the associated accounting period, alongside the most up-to-date months and associated accounting period as this would enable them to get an 'at-a-glance' view of the months left for an individual invoice if a query was received by DHSC. Instead of having to go into each individual resubmission to find the invoice and their latest value, they could access this screen and get that information easily. <b>** This design is yet to be implemented. **</b></li>
              <li>Users told us confirmed that they would not click the "View entitlement details" or person record link (whichever was included) on the <a href="version-39a/uk-claims/resubmissions/add-invoices-to-resubmission">Add invoices to resubmission screen</a>. They would only access this information if they were still required to check the invoice's date of birth to check what age bracket they fall into. However, as resubs, going forward, are split into specific age groups, they no longer have to worry about their being two separate invoices for the same person. This link has now been removed. However, the link is included in migrated mixed age group resubmissions as the requirement to check an invoice's date of birth is relevant.</li>
              <li>Users are not bothered if the button label for "Partially maintain and withdraw" is shortened to just "Partial" as they understand it's meaning either way. This button and it's position has now been changed so that it sits on the same line as the 'Maintain' and 'Withdraw' buttons.</li>
              <li>Users struggle with <a href="version-39a/uk-claims/resubmissions/enter-revised-accounting-period">entering the revised accounting period</a> when partially maintaining and withdrawing months. This is a completely new process for them. However, the service has determined that guidance and training will reduce confusion and instill confidence.</li>
              <li>Similarly to the above, half of users are unsure how to change the period of maintained and withdrawn months within the <a href="version-39a/uk-claims/resubmissions/cya-partial-maintain-and-partial-withdraw">Partial - Check your answers screen</a>. But when talking it through, and realising that the system calculates these two periods based on the revised accounting period that they input, they would know in future that this is how to change those periods if they didn't look correct. Again, this is another element which can be solved with guidance and training on the new system.</li>
              <li>Users would like to see the remaining amount of the claim on the <a href="version-39a/uk-claims/resubmissions/resubmission-summary">Resubmission summary screen</a> as they're unable to access the documents before or during peer review to check the latest claim value on the letter that is sent to the Member State. Being able to see this value would give users greater confidence that the resub they're working on now, logically follows the previous resub. <b>** This is yet to be implemented. **</b></li>
              <li>Users felt confused by the content "Total number of months remaining" on the <a href="version-39a/uk-claims/resubmissions/claim-summary">Claim summary screen</a> as they associate the word "Claimed" with the original value. This has now been changed to "Remaining total number of months" as users felt that the word "remaining" or "current" is clearer that it signifies the toal months left in the claim after a resub has been made.</li>

            </ul>

            <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Any known issues:</h3>
            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
              <li>The "Number of maintained invoices, including those partially maintained" and "Number of withdrawn invoices, including those partially withdrawn" on the <a href="version-39a/uk-claims/resubmissions/resubmission-summary">Resubmission summary screen</a> 
                does not make sense. You cannot maintain or withdraw the invoice itself, rather it's the months being claimed in their name. This causes confusion when the number of maintained and withdrawn 
                invoices exceeds the total number of contested invoices due to 1 invoice being split across both maintained and withdrawn if they are partially maintained and withdrawn. Therefore, this content has been removed from the resub summary altogether as it provides no values to users.</li>

            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
              <li>Users had no issues creating a new resubmission.</li>
              <li>On the 'Confirmation resubmission created' screen, we originally included links for users to download both the Acknowledgement Letter and Resubmission Summary documents. However,
                users told us that they are highly unlikely to do anything with these documnets at the point of creating a new resubmission. They also said that the acknowledgement letter would either
                be sent on RINA (for RINA contestations) or Office Support would send the acknowledgement letter when they receive a postal contestation, therefore, the need for Claims Officers to download the
                acknowledgement letter from the Ops system is not relevant. This meant that we were able to remove the two links to said documents, and during the second round of usability testing, users told us
                that the confirmation screen was now clearer and direct, and that they would expect to find the Acknowledgement Letter and Resubmission Summary under the 'Resubmission documents' tab, within an individual resubmission.
              </li>
              <li>Users are aware of the various resubmission statuses, though tend to only use the first few (e.g., To action, In progress, To review) to guide them throughout the resubmission process. Users did say,
                however, that they wouldn't rely solely on the resubmission statuses but would also use the resubmission ID, or the position in which it falls in a table (e.g., the most recently created/worked on resubmission would be at the top of the table).
                Users also said that if there were several resubmissions within one claim, they may use the filter to view resubmissions under 'To action' to locate the most recently created resubmission(s) to add invoices to.
              </li>
              <li>Users do not mind having to manually select invoices to add to a resubmission and even said, they couldn't think of another way to do this at this stage. They also highlighted how useful the check your answers - style screen is in terms of double checking
                they have selected the correct invoices to be added to the resubmission, with emphasis on the ability to add more invoices or remove any added by mistake. They also like the summary below the page heading which clearly tells them the total amount of months and invoices added to the resubmission.
                Furthermore, users also pointed out that our decision to split claims up across the different age groups makes selecting invoices easier as they no longer need to worry about one invoice being in a resub more than once - avoiding confusion.
              </li>
              <li>Users are generally happy with the information included in the invoices table when adding invoices to a resubmission, highlighting that too much information would clutter the screen and become unhelpful. While they're used to need to check the invoice's personal details to check their date of birth in their 
                person record on MedBen, users stated that because the Ops system will divide claims into age groups, they would no longer feel the need to check an invoices' personal details as they would expect the system to correctly pull the right invoices into the correct claim i.e., using their date of birth to determine which age groups
                the invoice should fall into when creating a new claim. If users did still feel the need to check the invoices' personal or entitlement details, they would navigate out of the resubmission and go to Search to find the person's record.
              </li>
              <li>Users said they're pleased they are able to create numerous resubmissions within one claim so that multiple Claims Officers can work on different contestations in parallel with one another. They pointed out that the system should not be able to pull in invoices already in an in-progress resubmission though as 
                this has the potential to cause conflict in the totals. For example, if one Claim Officer set Jane Doe as 2 months withdrawn but another Claims Officer set her as fully maintained, the system and therefore users would become confused.
              </li>
              <li>Users stated their preference for the order in which resubmissions appear on the Claim Resubmissions tab, stating that resubmissions should be ordered in state of completion i.e., the most recently completed should be at the top of the table, with the first complete resubmission at the bottom.
                The preference stems from users' need to know if there was a previous resubmission and the total number of invoices and months maintained/withdrawn or partially maintained and withdrawn. They said not knowing the most recently completed resubmission could cause issues as it becomes time consuming 
                having to go into each resubmission to work out who actioned what and why.
              </li>
              <li>Users were at first, unsure about the 'Withdrawal letter' but after explaining this is only associated with a Credit Note, users understood what the Withdrawal Letter document contains and when it would be available to download from the 'Resubmission documents' tab within the individual resubmission.
              </li>
              <li>When investigating individual invoices and deciding whether to Maintain/Withdraw or Partially maintain and withdraw costs from the 'Invoice details', users would still want to view the invoice's person record and entitlement details to double check the information they're viewing is up-to-date and accurate, 
                this is especially important if an entitlement has been cancelled during or after the claim was generated and sent to the Member State. Users said they would go into the Case history - Entitlement history to view the date the entitlement was cancelled to help them work out the timeline of events, and subsequently make a decision.
                Users also pointed out that they would also want to check a person's notes in instances where information may have been added about their entitlement details such as any updates/changes, as these notes can provide context which helps inform their decisions. Users stated they would <b>prefer</b> a direct link to an invoice's person record as 
                navigating to Search and locating the correct individual for each invoice would be very time consuming and lots of clicks. Some users knew how to use the breadcrumbs to navigate out of the resubmission and into Search to look for the person record but their preference is a direct link to the person record.
              </li>
              <li>From our first round of research, we found that the 'Reasons for contestation' weren't quite right, with some not fitting the context of the Average Cost journey. Users told us that sometimes postal reasons can be different to RINA reasons and therefore they will use the 'Other' reason and free-type the reason here if 
                there is no pre-defined reason which matches what the Member State has provided. However, the second round of user research found that while there were a lot of reasons matching the S102 from RINA, users said that they may at some point in the future, need to use any of the reasons so it's good they match RINA.
              </li>
              <li>The first iteration of reasons for maintaining/withdrawing and partially maintaining and withdrawing matched the S104 Reply to contestation, however, user research found that users were confused to see some reasons in each of the different journeys. For example, they didn't expect to see 'Contestation accepted in full and IMO concerned is decreased.'
                within the Maintain journey as this reason means that the UK are accepting the Member State's contestation and fully withdrawing the entire months claimed. However, we knew that each reason would need surfaced and placed into the correct journey but want user and stakeholder feedback in order to do this. In the second round of user research, users noted a marked improvement
                and as they were going through each reason in the different pathways, found each reason in the correct pathway. They did however, notice that the reasons changed from checkboxes where multiple reasons could be selected, to radio buttons where only one reason could be selected. Some users said they would still like the ability to select more than one reason in order to select 'Other' where they can 
                provide more context around the reason they've selected. For example, if the invoice died, they would want to add comments that the Invoice died on X date, and that they had received an S016, or that they're maintaining the months claimed until they receive the requested evidence from the Member State. They prefer to add detail so that whoever picks up the resubmission in the future,
                understands the full picture of what's gone on and why certain decisions were made.

            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
              <li>Users find the warning screen helpful as said no matter how long you've been in a role, you can easily make mistakes. The warning screen is that extra opportunity to ensure you don't run a claim with the same criteria again. They also believe it may be better if duplicating Main claims can be blocked entirely, instead the warning should be used for Supplemental claims and no warning for Retroactive claims since the same criteria will need to be ran repeatedly for Retroactive claims.</li>
              <li>Users appreciate the system being designed in a way where the correct invoices i.e., those with S1/S072 entitlements registered within the last 12 months and not previously claimed, are pulled into Retroactive claims. They believe this will be more efficient and less time-consuming for them.</li>
              <li>Users also felt that removing the date the S1/S072 entitlement was registered from the invoices table made sense now that the system is pulling invoices in correctly as previously they would need to check this date to work out whether invoices would need removing from a Retroactive claim. Users said if they wanted to find this date now, they would expect to see it in the invoice's person record within their claim details.</li>
              <li>Users also discussed the report which they currently use to work out which invoices need pulling into a Retroactive claim, they find this quite difficult and time consuming so improving this process would be a huge advantage for them.</li>

            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
              <li>Despite the likelihood of users running a Main or Supplemental claim with the same criteria twice, there are still some concerns around using an 'View claim (opens in a new tab)' link on the warning screen as users may become confused and start actioning items in the newly opened tab and cause conflicts with data. The UCD team and BA have discussed this and have proposed removing the link to view other claims from the warning screen as believe it will be best if users select No, they do not want to run another claim with the same criteria, then go off and do their own investigation into the previously run claim
                using the claim ID which we provide users with on that warning screen. They can then decide if they want to create a claim with the same criteria twice.

              <li>Users prefer less text being on display within the Claim summary details on the 'Claim summary' tab of the claim as some users feel there's too many words, making it more difficult to pull out what they need to do.</li>

            <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">What we found:</h3>
            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
              <li>Users much prefer the shortened journey, expressing that it's more automated with fewer clicks than the previous design, meaning data input is more accurate and much quicker. Overall, users found the new design much more straight-forward.</li>
              <li>When presented with a particular scenario i.e., the entitlement holder has contacted us to let us know they've moved to The Netherlands, users felt torn between two cancellaton reasons - 'The entitlement holder lives in another Member State' and
                'The entitlement holder no longer lives in the UK'. We recognise that some scenarios may fall into more than one reason, and as we have aligned the cancellation reasons to those provided on RINA, it is less our problem but more RINA content in that 
                  cancellation reasons aren't as refined as needed. Users however felt that the 'Additional comments' box, where they could provide more context around the reason they selected was particularly helpful in these scenarios where cancellation reasons overlap.
                  One example we found users adding into the comments was the country that the entitlement holder moved to.</li>
              <li>Users like that we have kept the 'Additional comments (optional)' screen as it enables them to explain their decision-making process when selecting the cancellation reason, as well as the ability to add important dates associated with either a Member State
                  cancellation request which includes the date the S016 was received by the Member State, and the date the S017 was sent to the Member State, or if it's a UK-initiated cancellation then the date the S018 was sent to the Member State, and the date the S019 was
                  received from the Member State, alongside the RINA reference number.</li>
              <li>Users told us they would select different cancellation reasons when cancelling a Dependant's entitlement based on the knowledge that the Dependant's Main Insured had died. Some users said they would either select 'The entitlement holder is no longer insured 
                  by the Member State' because their logic is that the Dependant's entitlement is no longer valid when the Main Insured's entitlement is no longer valid, therefore, the Dependant becomes no longer insured if their Main insured dies. Users also said they would select the
                  'Other' cancellation reason, and explain in the comments that the Main insured had died, and the date they died.</li>
              <li>Users said they may want the ability to change the entitlement end date, and the date associated with the cancellation reason in instances where the Member State has made a mistake/provided us the incorrect end date, as this may mean that the two dates conflict.
                Users added they also may want the ability to edit the Additional comments, and provided examples of updating the date the S019 was received if they'd said they had sent the S018 to the Member State.

                  <li>Registering the Main's S1 entitlement based on information provided by the Memeber State.</li>

                3. Viewing the Case history including the person history and entitlement history.

                <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
                  <li>Users complete both the sending of the S073 registration confirmation and DL1609 document to the Main together.
                    They would prefer to write one note about these two tasks, using a template so they remember what to include in the note.</li>
                    <li>Users really like the ability to check answers throughout the entitlement registration journey, enabling them to correct any 
                      mistakes.</li>
                  <li>Users feel very positive about the design of the Notes section particularly around recording an optional RINA reference when making a note,
                     and the ability to filter notes by different entitlement type and keywords.</li>
                  <li>Users also like the Case history, particularly logs relating to changes made to different data on a person's record. The entitlement history is 
                    also very useful for seeing when the entitlement was registered, if any details have been changed, who made these changes and when, as well as when
                    an entitlement has been cancelled.</li>

        <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Any known issues:</h3>
          Through prototype walkthroughs and multiple discussions as a team, we found that the S1 entitlement registration journey does not flow logically when users are given the opportunity to add dependants.<br><br>
          Content also becomes convoluted when including dependants within the main S1 entitlement registration journey as the Main and Dependant's entitlements should be registered separately as it's rare we receive both S1 entitlements from the Member State together.<br><br>
          Therefore, the decision was made to decouple the dependants from the main S1 entitlement registration so that relevant content would be displayed, based on particular scenarios including:<br><br>
              
          <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
            <li>registering the Main's S1 entitlement from information provided by the Member State</li>
            <li>registering both the Main and Dependant's S1 entitlements from information provided by the Member State</li>
            <li>having already registered the Main's S1 entitlement, and receiving a completed DL1609 form - register any dependants' S1 entitlements</li>
            <li>registering the Main's S1 entitlement from an FAS1/Q enquriy</li>
            <li>registering an E109 - which is where the dependant is living in the UK but is eligible for an S1 based on the Main's eligibility</li>
          </ul> 
          
          <br>

          The new approach can be found in Version 30.

        <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">What we found:</h3>
        <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
          <li>Cost Recovery Officers appreciate our approach to the S1 Registerations and Cancellations work and like the direction we're heading in. They believe that the stages of searching for a person, creating a new person record, and being able to view and update personal details is simple and easy to use.</li>
          <li>At this stage, there isn't a user need for the <a href="version-28/s1/account/patient-summary">Person Overview</a> screen, rather it is a nice-to-have feature which would simply enhance the portal. Therefore, we plan to drop this screen from the MVP.</li>
          <li>Cost Recovery Officers also like the <a href="version-28/s1/account/entitlement-details?add-new-entitlement=yes">Entitlements and enquiries</a> section but think it needs improvement, particularly around the type of information that is displayed as part of the overview. As part of improvement work, they would like to be able to clearly see the status of each entitlement e.g., registered or cancelled.</li>
          <li>Cost Recovery Officers believe that <b>Case History</b> should contain system updates e.g., record created, first name updated, email added, etc. whereas <b>Notes</b> should be used by Cost Recovery Officers to provide context, and effectively 'paint the bigger picture' of the person's record. For example, notes could include anything from a complaint, to information regarding a conversation that might have taken place between one CR Officer and the individual. It may also contain details around any letters or documents that have been sent or received.</li>
          <li>Individual Notes tabs should be removed from both the <a href="version-28/s1/account/patient-details">Personal details section</a> and <a href="version-28/s1/account/entitlement-content/S1-entitlement-details">individual entitlements</a>. Instead, a separate Notes tab should be added to the left-hand navigation menu so that the notes are against the entire person record, as opposed to individual entitlements. This will help CR and Claims officers understand the wider context of each person's record and attached details.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Any known issues:</h3>
        <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
          <li>Cost Recovery Officers will very rarely input the UK NINO number when creating the person record so as part of the next version of the prototype, this data point should be removed from the <a href="version-28/s1/account/create-person-record">Personal details data entry</a> screen and instead, left for CR Officer to update in the <a href="version-28/s1/account/patient-details">Personal details</a> section of the person record, if and when they receive this information. For example, from a third party referral, on the back of receiving the FAS1Q or DL1609.</li>
