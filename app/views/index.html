            <ul>
              <li>Mixed Age group claim and resubmissions journey.</li>
              <li>Various smaller content and design tweaks from the previous round of user research, including updating the remaining total summary list heading on the <a href="version-40/uk-claims/resubmissions/claim-summary">Claim summary screen</a> from "Total number of months claimed" to "Remaining total number of months" to avoid user confusion between the original value vs. the updated value.</li>
              <li>Button content within the <a href="version-40/uk-claims/resubmissions/invoice-details?invoice=John">Invoice details</a> has changed from "Partially maintain and withdraw" to just "Partial" which means the button is not only concise but is also able to sit on the same lines as the "Maintain" and "Withdraw" buttons. To view the buttons, you must select a reason for contestation and Save and submit.</li>
              <li>We have also removed two rows from the <a href="version-40/uk-claims/resubmissions/resubmission-summary">Resubmission summary:</a> "Total number of maintained invoices, including those partially maintained" and "Total number of maintained invoices, including those partially maintained" because this is unnecessary information that could cause users confusion if the total amounts
                 exceed the total number of contested invoices. This happens because 1 invoice can be split across both Maintained and Withdrawn if they're set as Partial, meaning that it would look like 2 invoices have been actioned, when actually it's just the same invoice split across maintain and withdraw. But we know that invoices themselves aren't what is maintained/withdrawn/partially maintained and withdrawn but it's the <b>months</b> that are.</li>

              <li>Review the invoices within the resubmission including adding the reason for contestation, uploading any evidence, and investigating the invoices and entitlement details to make a decision to either Maintain, Withdraw or Partially maintain and withdraw.</li>
              <li>Once happy with each invoice within the resubmission, send it for peer review</li>
              <li>Peer review the resubmission, and once done, mark it as "Peer reviewed"</li>

            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
              <li>Users had no issues creating a new resubmission.</li>
              <li>On the 'Confirmation resubmission created' screen, we originally included links for users to download both the Acknowledgement Letter and Resubmission Summary documents. However,
                users told us that they are highly unlikely to do anything with these documnets at the point of creating a new resubmission. They also said that the acknowledgement letter would either
                be sent on RINA (for RINA contestations) or Office Support would send the acknowledgement letter when they receive a postal contestation, therefore, the need for Claims Officers to download the
                acknowledgement letter from the Ops system is not relevant. This meant that we were able to remove the two links to said documents, and during the second round of usability testing, users told us
                that the confirmation screen was now clearer and direct, and that they would expect to find the Acknowledgement Letter and Resubmission Summary under the 'Resubmission documents' tab, within an individual resubmission.
              </li>
              <li>Users are aware of the various resubmission statuses, though tend to only use the first few (e.g., To action, In progress, To review) to guide them throughout the resubmission process. Users did say,
                however, that they wouldn't rely solely on the resubmission statuses but would also use the resubmission ID, or the position in which it falls in a table (e.g., the most recently created/worked on resubmission would be at the top of the table).
                Users also said that if there were several resubmissions within one claim, they may use the filter to view resubmissions under 'To action' to locate the most recently created resubmission(s) to add invoices to.
              </li>
              <li>Users do not mind having to manually select invoices to add to a resubmission and even said, they couldn't think of another way to do this at this stage. They also highlighted how useful the check your answers - style screen is in terms of double checking
                they have selected the correct invoices to be added to the resubmission, with emphasis on the ability to add more invoices or remove any added by mistake. They also like the summary below the page heading which clearly tells them the total amount of months and invoices added to the resubmission.
                Furthermore, users also pointed out that our decision to split claims up across the different age groups makes selecting invoices easier as they no longer need to worry about one invoice being in a resub more than once - avoiding confusion.
              </li>
              <li>Users are generally happy with the information included in the invoices table when adding invoices to a resubmission, highlighting that too much information would clutter the screen and become unhelpful. While they're used to need to check the invoice's personal details to check their date of birth in their 
                person record on MedBen, users stated that because the Ops system will divide claims into age groups, they would no longer feel the need to check an invoices' personal details as they would expect the system to correctly pull the right invoices into the correct claim i.e., using their date of birth to determine which age groups
                the invoice should fall into when creating a new claim. If users did still feel the need to check the invoices' personal or entitlement details, they would navigate out of the resubmission and go to Search to find the person's record.
              </li>
              <li>Users said they're pleased they are able to create numerous resubmissions within one claim so that multiple Claims Officers can work on different contestations in parallel with one another. They pointed out that the system should not be able to pull in invoices already in an in-progress resubmission though as 
                this has the potential to cause conflict in the totals. For example, if one Claim Officer set Jane Doe as 2 months withdrawn but another Claims Officer set her as fully maintained, the system and therefore users would become confused.
              </li>
              <li>Users stated their preference for the order in which resubmissions appear on the Claim Resubmissions tab, stating that resubmissions should be ordered in state of completion i.e., the most recently completed should be at the top of the table, with the first complete resubmission at the bottom.
                The preference stems from users' need to know if there was a previous resubmission and the total number of invoices and months maintained/withdrawn or partially maintained and withdrawn. They said not knowing the most recently completed resubmission could cause issues as it becomes time consuming 
                having to go into each resubmission to work out who actioned what and why.
              </li>
              <li>Users were at first, unsure about the 'Withdrawal letter' but after explaining this is only associated with a Credit Note, users understood what the Withdrawal Letter document contains and when it would be available to download from the 'Resubmission documents' tab within the individual resubmission.
              </li>
              <li>When investigating individual invoices and deciding whether to Maintain/Withdraw or Partially maintain and withdraw costs from the 'Invoice details', users would still want to view the invoice's person record and entitlement details to double check the information they're viewing is up-to-date and accurate, 
                this is especially important if an entitlement has been cancelled during or after the claim was generated and sent to the Member State. Users said they would go into the Case history - Entitlement history to view the date the entitlement was cancelled to help them work out the timeline of events, and subsequently make a decision.
                Users also pointed out that they would also want to check a person's notes in instances where information may have been added about their entitlement details such as any updates/changes, as these notes can provide context which helps inform their decisions. Users stated they would <b>prefer</b> a direct link to an invoice's person record as 
                navigating to Search and locating the correct individual for each invoice would be very time consuming and lots of clicks. Some users knew how to use the breadcrumbs to navigate out of the resubmission and into Search to look for the person record but their preference is a direct link to the person record.
              </li>
              <li>From our first round of research, we found that the 'Reasons for contestation' weren't quite right, with some not fitting the context of the Average Cost journey. Users told us that sometimes postal reasons can be different to RINA reasons and therefore they will use the 'Other' reason and free-type the reason here if 
                there is no pre-defined reason which matches what the Member State has provided. However, the second round of user research found that while there were a lot of reasons matching the S102 from RINA, users said that they may at some point in the future, need to use any of the reasons so it's good they match RINA.
              </li>
              <li>The first iteration of reasons for maintaining/withdrawing and partially maintaining and withdrawing matched the S104 Reply to contestation, however, user research found that users were confused to see some reasons in each of the different journeys. For example, they didn't expect to see 'Contestation accepted in full and IMO concerned is decreased.'
                within the Maintain journey as this reason means that the UK are accepting the Member State's contestation and fully withdrawing the entire months claimed. However, we knew that each reason would need surfaced and placed into the correct journey but want user and stakeholder feedback in order to do this. In the second round of user research, users noted a marked improvement
                and as they were going through each reason in the different pathways, found each reason in the correct pathway. They did however, notice that the reasons changed from checkboxes where multiple reasons could be selected, to radio buttons where only one reason could be selected. Some users said they would still like the ability to select more than one reason in order to select 'Other' where they can 
                provide more context around the reason they've selected. For example, if the invoice died, they would want to add comments that the Invoice died on X date, and that they had received an S016, or that they're maintaining the months claimed until they receive the requested evidence from the Member State. They prefer to add detail so that whoever picks up the resubmission in the future,
                understands the full picture of what's gone on and why certain decisions were made.

            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
              <li>Users find the warning screen helpful as said no matter how long you've been in a role, you can easily make mistakes. The warning screen is that extra opportunity to ensure you don't run a claim with the same criteria again. They also believe it may be better if duplicating Main claims can be blocked entirely, instead the warning should be used for Supplemental claims and no warning for Retroactive claims since the same criteria will need to be ran repeatedly for Retroactive claims.</li>
              <li>Users appreciate the system being designed in a way where the correct invoices i.e., those with S1/S072 entitlements registered within the last 12 months and not previously claimed, are pulled into Retroactive claims. They believe this will be more efficient and less time-consuming for them.</li>
              <li>Users also felt that removing the date the S1/S072 entitlement was registered from the invoices table made sense now that the system is pulling invoices in correctly as previously they would need to check this date to work out whether invoices would need removing from a Retroactive claim. Users said if they wanted to find this date now, they would expect to see it in the invoice's person record within their claim details.</li>
              <li>Users also discussed the report which they currently use to work out which invoices need pulling into a Retroactive claim, they find this quite difficult and time consuming so improving this process would be a huge advantage for them.</li>

            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
              <li>Despite the likelihood of users running a Main or Supplemental claim with the same criteria twice, there are still some concerns around using an 'View claim (opens in a new tab)' link on the warning screen as users may become confused and start actioning items in the newly opened tab and cause conflicts with data. The UCD team and BA have discussed this and have proposed removing the link to view other claims from the warning screen as believe it will be best if users select No, they do not want to run another claim with the same criteria, then go off and do their own investigation into the previously run claim
                using the claim ID which we provide users with on that warning screen. They can then decide if they want to create a claim with the same criteria twice.

              <li>Users prefer less text being on display within the Claim summary details on the 'Claim summary' tab of the claim as some users feel there's too many words, making it more difficult to pull out what they need to do.</li>

              <li>Users believe that Retroactive claims should only pull in invoices with entitlements that were registered within the last 12 months and cannot pull in an invoice which has already been claimed for.</li>

            <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">What we found:</h3>
            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
              <li>Users much prefer the shortened journey, expressing that it's more automated with fewer clicks than the previous design, meaning data input is more accurate and much quicker. Overall, users found the new design much more straight-forward.</li>
              <li>When presented with a particular scenario i.e., the entitlement holder has contacted us to let us know they've moved to The Netherlands, users felt torn between two cancellaton reasons - 'The entitlement holder lives in another Member State' and
                'The entitlement holder no longer lives in the UK'. We recognise that some scenarios may fall into more than one reason, and as we have aligned the cancellation reasons to those provided on RINA, it is less our problem but more RINA content in that 
                  cancellation reasons aren't as refined as needed. Users however felt that the 'Additional comments' box, where they could provide more context around the reason they selected was particularly helpful in these scenarios where cancellation reasons overlap.
                  One example we found users adding into the comments was the country that the entitlement holder moved to.</li>
              <li>Users like that we have kept the 'Additional comments (optional)' screen as it enables them to explain their decision-making process when selecting the cancellation reason, as well as the ability to add important dates associated with either a Member State
                  cancellation request which includes the date the S016 was received by the Member State, and the date the S017 was sent to the Member State, or if it's a UK-initiated cancellation then the date the S018 was sent to the Member State, and the date the S019 was
                  received from the Member State, alongside the RINA reference number.</li>
              <li>Users told us they would select different cancellation reasons when cancelling a Dependant's entitlement based on the knowledge that the Dependant's Main Insured had died. Some users said they would either select 'The entitlement holder is no longer insured 
                  by the Member State' because their logic is that the Dependant's entitlement is no longer valid when the Main Insured's entitlement is no longer valid, therefore, the Dependant becomes no longer insured if their Main insured dies. Users also said they would select the
                  'Other' cancellation reason, and explain in the comments that the Main insured had died, and the date they died.</li>
              <li>Users said they may want the ability to change the entitlement end date, and the date associated with the cancellation reason in instances where the Member State has made a mistake/provided us the incorrect end date, as this may mean that the two dates conflict.
                Users added they also may want the ability to edit the Additional comments, and provided examples of updating the date the S019 was received if they'd said they had sent the S018 to the Member State.

                <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
                  <li>Registering the Main's S1 entitlement based on information provided by the Memeber State.</li>

                </ul>
                

                2. Linking the Dependant to the Main's S1 entitlement.
                <br><br>
                3. Viewing the Case history including the person history and entitlement history.

                <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s">What we found:</h3>
                <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
                  <li>Users complete both the sending of the S073 registration confirmation and DL1609 document to the Main together.
                    They would prefer to write one note about these two tasks, using a template so they remember what to include in the note.</li>
                    <li>Users really like the ability to check answers throughout the entitlement registration journey, enabling them to correct any 
                      mistakes.</li>
                  <li>Users feel very positive about the design of the Notes section particularly around recording an optional RINA reference when making a note,
                     and the ability to filter notes by different entitlement type and keywords.</li>
                  <li>Users also like the Case history, particularly logs relating to changes made to different data on a person's record. The entitlement history is 
                    also very useful for seeing when the entitlement was registered, if any details have been changed, who made these changes and when, as well as when
                    an entitlement has been cancelled.</li>

        <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Any known issues:</h3>
          Through prototype walkthroughs and multiple discussions as a team, we found that the S1 entitlement registration journey does not flow logically when users are given the opportunity to add dependants.<br><br>
          Content also becomes convoluted when including dependants within the main S1 entitlement registration journey as the Main and Dependant's entitlements should be registered separately as it's rare we receive both S1 entitlements from the Member State together.<br><br>
          Therefore, the decision was made to decouple the dependants from the main S1 entitlement registration so that relevant content would be displayed, based on particular scenarios including:<br><br>
              
          <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
            <li>registering the Main's S1 entitlement from information provided by the Member State</li>
            <li>registering both the Main and Dependant's S1 entitlements from information provided by the Member State</li>
            <li>having already registered the Main's S1 entitlement, and receiving a completed DL1609 form - register any dependants' S1 entitlements</li>
            <li>registering the Main's S1 entitlement from an FAS1/Q enquriy</li>
            <li>registering an E109 - which is where the dependant is living in the UK but is eligible for an S1 based on the Main's eligibility</li>
          </ul> 
          
          <br>

          The new approach can be found in Version 30.

            In this version you will see a pivot in our approach from a GDS citizen-style service to an admin-style portal whereby the

            been created, the user can then update personal details, add entitlements and add dependants. Other processes such as 
            enquries and cancellations are yet to be worked on.</span>

        <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">What we found:</h3>
        <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
          <li>Cost Recovery Officers appreciate our approach to the S1 Registerations and Cancellations work and like the direction we're heading in. They believe that the stages of searching for a person, creating a new person record, and being able to view and update personal details is simple and easy to use.</li>
          <li>At this stage, there isn't a user need for the <a href="version-28/s1/account/patient-summary">Person Overview</a> screen, rather it is a nice-to-have feature which would simply enhance the portal. Therefore, we plan to drop this screen from the MVP.</li>
          <li>Cost Recovery Officers also like the <a href="version-28/s1/account/entitlement-details?add-new-entitlement=yes">Entitlements and enquiries</a> section but think it needs improvement, particularly around the type of information that is displayed as part of the overview. As part of improvement work, they would like to be able to clearly see the status of each entitlement e.g., registered or cancelled.</li>
          <li>Cost Recovery Officers believe that <b>Case History</b> should contain system updates e.g., record created, first name updated, email added, etc. whereas <b>Notes</b> should be used by Cost Recovery Officers to provide context, and effectively 'paint the bigger picture' of the person's record. For example, notes could include anything from a complaint, to information regarding a conversation that might have taken place between one CR Officer and the individual. It may also contain details around any letters or documents that have been sent or received.</li>
          <li>Individual Notes tabs should be removed from both the <a href="version-28/s1/account/patient-details">Personal details section</a> and <a href="version-28/s1/account/entitlement-content/S1-entitlement-details">individual entitlements</a>. Instead, a separate Notes tab should be added to the left-hand navigation menu so that the notes are against the entire person record, as opposed to individual entitlements. This will help CR and Claims officers understand the wider context of each person's record and attached details.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Any known issues:</h3>
        <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
          <li>Cost Recovery Officers will very rarely input the UK NINO number when creating the person record so as part of the next version of the prototype, this data point should be removed from the <a href="version-28/s1/account/create-person-record">Personal details data entry</a> screen and instead, left for CR Officer to update in the <a href="version-28/s1/account/patient-details">Personal details</a> section of the person record, if and when they receive this information. For example, from a third party referral, on the back of receiving the FAS1Q or DL1609.</li>
